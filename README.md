# Maze-Solver-Using-BFS-and-DFS
This is a Python project that creates a random maze and automatically finds a path from the start to the goal using classic pathfinding algorithms like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search. The maze is represented as a 2D grid where some cells are walls and others are walkable paths. The solver visualizes the steps taken to find a valid path.
